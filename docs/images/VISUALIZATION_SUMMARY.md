  - Overall distribution (250 patients) vs GT>0 only (200 patients)
  - Performance tier breakdown (High/Good/Moderate/Poor)
  - Statistical comparison with means and medians
  - Box plot comparison
- **Actual Stats**:
  - Overall Mean Dice: 0.748
  - GT>0 Mean Dice: 0.690
  - High performers (≥0.8): ~45 patients

### 2. `patient_190_slice_89_final.png`
**Patient 190 Slice 89 Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Content**: Side-by-side visualization as requested
- **Layout**: 3 panels showing:
  1. **Ground Truth (Green)**: DWI background with green lesion overlay
  2. **Model Prediction (Red)**: DWI background with red prediction overlay  
  3. **Combined Analysis**: 
     - Green = Missed lesions (False Negatives)
     - Red = False positives 
     - Yellow = Correct predictions (True Positives)
- **Patient 190 Stats**:
  - Overall Dice: 0.812 (Excellent performance)
  - GT Volume: 10,923 voxels
  - Pred Volume: 15,438 voxels
  - Slice 89 has 508 GT voxels, 544 predicted voxels

### 3. `performance_analysis.png`
**Comprehensive Performance Analysis Charts**
- **Content**: 4-panel analysis of model performance
- **Panels**:
  1. **Performance vs Lesion Size**: Scatter plot showing dice scores vs lesion volumes
  2. **Distribution Comparison**: Histogram comparing all cases vs GT>0 cases
  3. **Performance Tiers**: Bar chart of High/Good/Moderate/Poor performers
  4. **Size Category Analysis**: Violin plots for Small/Medium/Large lesions
- **Key Insights**:
  - Larger lesions generally achieve better dice scores
  - Small lesions (<1K voxels) show more variable performance
  - Medium lesions (1K-10K) show consistent good performance

### 4. `alignment_showcase.png`
**SEALS-Aligned Multimodal Data Showcase**
- **Content**: Demonstration of spatial alignment quality
- **Layout**: 3 panels showing:
  1. **Aligned DWI**: Reference modality
  2. **Aligned ADC**: Spatially registered to DWI
  3. **Multimodal Overlay**: Combined visualization
- **Technical Details**:
  - Shows sub-voxel accuracy registration
  - Demonstrates multimodal fusion capability
  - Critical for accurate segmentation performance
